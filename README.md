# healthcarechatbot
I developed a healthcare chatbot application using Python, Flask, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system can take user input in natural language and respond with relevant healthcare information. Key features include: identifying diseases from symptoms, providing symptoms for a given disease, giving detailed information about medicines.
